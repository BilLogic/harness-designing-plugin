## [Unreleased]

*(No changes since [1.0.0] full release.)*

## [1.0.0] — 2026-04-17 (full release — all four skills)

First public release. Four-skill design-harness plug-in, full-release at v1.0.0. Users get the complete set immediately — no phased rollout.

### Added

**Four complete skills:**

- **`hd-onboard`** — LEARN verb. Article-backed Q&A about the five-layer framework (Context / Skills / Orchestration / Rubrics / Knowledge). 11 files: SKILL.md router + 10 atomic reference files (concept-overview, memory-taxonomy, 5 layer explainers, glossary, 10-question FAQ, compound-engineering coexistence). 53 article § citations across the skill.

- **`hd-setup`** — SETUP verb. Adaptive scaffold / reorganize / audit of the five-layer harness in a user's repo. 23 files: SKILL.md router + 9 references (5 layer-specific + 4 shared: tier-budget-model, good-agents-md-patterns, coexistence-checklist, local-md-schema) + 3 workflows (greenfield / scattered / advanced) + 9 templates (AGENTS.md, design-harnessing.local.md, context-skeleton with 4 sub-files, knowledge-skeleton with 3 sub-files) + `scripts/detect-mode.sh` deterministic bash mode detection emitting LOCKED JSON shape.

- **`hd-compound`** — MAINTAIN verb. Capture lessons + graduate to rules. **SHA-256 plan-hash proof-of-consent** for the destructive AGENTS.md write prevents hallucinated approval from runaway agents or LLM-default "yes" completions. 9 files: SKILL.md + 3 references (lesson-patterns, graduation-criteria, plan-hash-protocol) + 3 workflows (capture, propose-graduation, apply-graduation) + 2 templates.

- **`hd-review`** — IMPROVE verb. Audit harness health (multi-agent orchestration via Task tool, parallel/serial auto-switch at 6+ agents per compound 2.39.0 lesson) + critique work items against team rubrics. Declares `<protected_artifacts>` block so `/ce:review` respects our outputs during cross-plug-in runs. 15 files: SKILL.md + 5 references + 3 workflows (audit-parallel, audit-serial, critique) + 2 templates + 3 starter rubrics (accessibility-wcag-aa, design-system-compliance, component-budget) + `scripts/budget-check.sh`.

**Three sibling manifests (cross-platform submission from day one):**
- `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` — Claude Code marketplace
- `.codex-plugin/plugin.json` — Codex CLI directory
- `.cursor-plugin/plugin.json` — Cursor marketplace
- `.cursor/rules/AGENTS.mdc` — Cursor IDE thin redirect → AGENTS.md

**Universal conventions:**
- `AGENTS.md` — canonical conventions doc (read natively by Claude Code, Codex CLI, Cursor CLI, Windsurf, GitHub Copilot)
- `CLAUDE.md` — one-line `@AGENTS.md` pointer (belt-and-suspenders)

**Meta-harness (dogfood):**
- `docs/context/` — Layer 1 for this plug-in's own build (agent-persona, product one-pager, design-system/file conventions cheat-sheet, conventions/how-we-work)
- `docs/knowledge/` — Layer 5 with 3 real lessons from the build session + one graduation visible in git history
- `docs/rubrics/INDEX.md` — Layer 4 thin pointer (distributed-pattern explainer)
- `docs/plans/` — PRDs + implementation plans + scenario matrices (historical record of the build)

**First graduated rule (via episodic→procedural graduation):**
- "Don't ship future-version skill stubs with `disable-model-invocation: true`" — lesson + AGENTS.md rule + graduations.md meta-entry. Surfaced by `/ce:review` synthesis of 3 independent reviewer agents. Informed the decision to ship all four skills together rather than stage behind article cadence.

### Changed

- Flattened repo layout from `plugins/design-harness/*` to repo root (single-plug-in repo; not marketplace-shape).

### Removed

- Nested `plugins/design-harness/` directory (single-plug-in repo).
- `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` (single plug-in, not marketplace).
- Superseded PRD drafts (v0.2 baseline, v0.3 deepened, 004 rejected 6-skill taxonomy) — preserved in git history.
- Empty `agents/` directory tree (zero sub-agents shipped; uses compound-engineering's via fully-qualified Task calls).
- `CONTRIBUTING.md` placeholder (single-author repo; no contribution pipeline yet).
- Staged/phased release plans — all four skills ship together at v1.0.0.

### Coexistence

All namespace-isolation rules with `compound-engineering` locked in. See [AGENTS.md § Coexistence](AGENTS.md#coexistence-with-compound-engineering).

### Acceptance

Per `docs/plans/2026-04-16-005-feat-v0-mvp-implementation-plan.md` + 006 + 007:
- Phase 1 structural refactor passed 10/10 verification checks (commit `6d7a5e16`)
- hd-onboard passed 7/7 acceptance checks (commit `d361bb2e`)
- hd-setup passed 8/8 acceptance checks (commit `b4387dd2`)
- Meta-harness + graduation example (commit `712222aa`)
- hd-compound with plan-hash protocol (commit `540a1b45`)
- hd-review with `<protected_artifacts>` block + budget-check.sh (commit `5a871c87`)
- README + CHANGELOG reflect full-release state (commit `ddd159cd` + this commit)

### Pending before public ship

- n=5 usability tests per skill (median TTFUI ≤30 min; median "articulate value" ≤5 min)
- 12/12 scenario tests per `docs/plans/hd-setup-success-criteria.md`
- Plan-hash round-trip smoke test for hd-compound (propose → apply on scratch repo)
- Audit smoke test for hd-review (verify exactly 1 write to `docs/knowledge/lessons/harness-audit-*.md`)
- Article URLs filled in (currently *TBD* placeholders in README + manifest descriptions)
- Release tag `v1.0.0` pushed to remote
