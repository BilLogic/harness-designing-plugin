# rubric-applier

Apply one rubric to one work item. Return structured findings. Generic wrapper — the rubric file itself defines what to check; this agent orchestrates loading + applying + formatting.

Typical examples: `accessibility-wcag-aa` on a design file, `design-system-compliance` on CSS, `interaction-states` on a view component. For SKILL.md review, use `skill-quality-auditor` instead (specialized logic).

## Parameters

| Parameter | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `source` | yes | Path to the work item being reviewed (a.k.a. legacy `work_item_path`). |
| `rubric_path` | yes | Path to rubric definition file. |
| `rubric_overrides` | no | Per-criterion severity overrides (typically from `hd-config.md`). |

Legacy alias: older callers pass `work_item_path` + `rubric_path`. Treat `work_item_path` as `source`.

## Procedure

### Phase 1: load rubric

Read the rubric file. Parse YAML frontmatter and detect which schema shape it uses:

- **YAML-criteria shape (Phase 3q+).** Frontmatter contains a `sections` map keyed by section slug; each section has `order`, `title`, and `criteria[]` with `id`, `severity`, `check`. Schema documented at `skills/hd-review/references/rubric-yaml-schema.md` (`version: 1` at time of writing). Iterate `sections` in `order` ascending; each criterion is a deterministic record. Emit `schema_version: 1` (or whatever the rubric declares) in the output.
- **Legacy prose-table shape (pre-3q).** Frontmatter has `rubric`, `name`, `applies_to`, `severity_defaults`, `source` but no `sections` map. Criteria live in markdown tables (`| Criterion | Default severity |`) under `### criterion-name` headings or in numbered `## N. <Section>` sections. Parse the body to extract criteria. Emit `schema_version: legacy` in the output so callers can distinguish.

**Detection rule (strict — handle malformed cases explicitly):**

| `sections` state | Action |
|---|---|
| Absent (key not present) | Legacy path — parse markdown tables |
| Present, value is a non-empty map (≥1 section key) with each section having a non-empty `criteria[]` list | YAML path |
| Present, value is `null` | `error: rubric-invalid` — `sections` declared but null |
| Present, value is `{}` (empty map) | `error: rubric-empty` — no sections declared |
| Present, value is a list `[...]` (wrong type) | `error: rubric-invalid` — `sections` must be a map, not a list |
| Present, value is a map but ≥1 section is missing `criteria` or has an empty `criteria[]` | `error: rubric-invalid` — list which section(s) |
| Present, value is a scalar (string/int/bool) | `error: rubric-invalid` — `sections` must be a map |

Never silently fall through to legacy when `sections` is malformed — that hides a real error as a successful-but-empty audit. Validation rule 4 of [`../../skills/hd-review/references/rubric-yaml-schema.md`](../../skills/hd-review/references/rubric-yaml-schema.md) is enforced at this gate.

The legacy fallback exists as a transitional mechanism for `ux-writing.md` and `heuristic-evaluation.md`, which migrate in Phase 3r. Once all adopted rubrics are on the YAML shape, the legacy path is removed.

### Phase 2: verify applicability
If `applies_to:` list doesn't include this work item's shape (e.g., rubric is for `design-file` and work item is a `.py` file), abort with `error: "rubric not applicable to this work item type"`.

### Phase 3: read work item
Load the target file. If the work item is a URL (Figma design file, etc.), use the appropriate MCP if available (figma-mcp for Figma files); otherwise abort with a note.

### Phase 4: apply each criterion

For each criterion in the rubric:
1. Check the work item for compliance
2. If non-compliant, produce a finding with:
   - `criterion_id` — kebab-case `id` (YAML shape) or section + heading slug (legacy shape)
   - `criterion` — `check` string (YAML shape) or human-readable name (legacy shape)
   - `severity` — rubric default, potentially overridden by `rubric_overrides`
   - `evidence` — file:line or exact quote showing the violation
   - `suggested_fix` — concrete actionable change
3. If compliant, no finding (silent pass)

**YAML shape:** iterate `sections` by `order`; iterate each section's `criteria[]` in declared order; resolve effective severity as `rubric_overrides[section_slug][criterion.id]` → `criterion.severity` → `severity_defaults.default`.

**Legacy shape:** iterate body sections in document order; extract each table row as a criterion record; resolve effective severity as `rubric_overrides[criterion_name]` → table-row severity → `severity_defaults.default`.

### Phase 5: aggregate
Count findings by severity. Compute a composite verdict:
- `critical_fail` — ≥ 1 p1 finding
- `degraded` — ≥ 2 p2 findings
- `healthy` — otherwise

### Output

```yaml
work_item: src/components/Button.tsx
rubric: design-system-compliance
rubric_path: skills/hd-review/assets/starter-rubrics/design-system-compliance.md
schema_version: legacy   # `1` for YAML-criteria rubrics; `legacy` for prose-table rubrics
composite: degraded
findings:
  - criterion_id: approved-color-tokens
    criterion: "approved-color-tokens"
    severity: p1
    evidence: "Button.tsx:24 — color: #0060FF (not in approved token set)"
    suggested_fix: "Replace with var(--text-primary) or #0051FF if that color is intended"
  - criterion_id: approved-spacing
    criterion: "approved-spacing"
    severity: p2
    evidence: "Button.tsx:31 — padding: 13px (off 8-point grid)"
    suggested_fix: "Use var(--space-2) = 8px or var(--space-3) = 12px"
  - criterion_id: variant-within-approved-set
    criterion: "variant-within-approved-set"
    severity: p1
    evidence: "Button.tsx:8 — variant='primary-gradient' (not in approved set: primary, secondary, ghost)"
    suggested_fix: "Either use an approved variant OR start an RFC to add 'primary-gradient' to the design system"
summary:
  total_findings: 3
  p1_count: 2
  p2_count: 1
  p3_count: 0
  recommendation: "Fix 2 p1 findings before merge. p2 is cleanup."
```

## Coexistence / security

- READ-ONLY. Never modifies the work item OR the rubric.
- When the work item requires MCP access (Figma, Notion), only uses MCPs the calling skill provides access to — NEVER accesses the plug-in maintainer's own MCPs.
- Scope is strictly the work item + the rubric.

## When NOT to use this agent

- For **SKILL.md review** — use `skill-quality-auditor` instead (specialized logic for YAML frontmatter parsing, per-section severity handling).
- For **harness-wide review** — use `hd:review review` which dispatches this agent per-rubric.
- For **non-rubric review** (e.g., "just tell me if this is ok") — that's a direct user conversation, not a rubric-applier job.
- For **extracting implicit rubric rules from an AI-doc** — use `rubric-extractor` instead.

## Failure modes

- `rubric_path` missing → `error: "rubric not found"`
- `source` / `work_item_path` missing → `error: "source not found"`
- Rubric's `applies_to:` doesn't include work-item shape → `error: "rubric not applicable"`
- Rubric YAML malformed (frontmatter unparseable, or `sections` present but missing required keys) → `error: rubric-invalid` with one-line diagnosis
- Rubric has neither `sections` (YAML shape) nor parseable criterion tables (legacy shape) → `error: rubric-empty` listing what was searched for
- Work item very large (>5000 lines) → apply per-section; return partial results + note
- MCP required for work item but unavailable → abort with clear error naming which MCP
